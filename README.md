## Getting started

After cloning the repository do the following
1. Create a python virtual environment and install dependencies (run from the project directory). This will install dependencies from poetry.lock
    ```shell script
    poetry install
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment in terminal
    ```shell script
    poetry shell
    ```
